**Note:** Replace ```Sergey Shlyakhov``` ```husband``` ```https://github.com/husband``` ```husband.sergey@gmail.com``` ```husband``` ```elasticvis``` ```Search and search as you type for VisBuilder. Based on ElasticSearch``` with their correct values in [README.md](README.md), [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md), [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) and [composer.json](composer.json) files, then delete this line. You can run `$ php prefill.php` in the command line to make all replacements at once. Delete the file prefill.php as well.

This is where your description should go. Try and limit it to a paragraph or two, and maybe throw in a mention of what
PSRs you support to avoid any confusion with users and contributors.
